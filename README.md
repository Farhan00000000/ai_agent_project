## Notes

- The GPT model `gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin` is **not included** in this repository due to size limitations. You can download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HNQ1rldmtHPT23un8zPtYLfkv7k38f9w?usp=sharing) and place it in the project root directory.  
- The demo video is also **hosted externally** because it exceeds GitHub's file size limit. You can view/download it from [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HNQ1rldmtHPT23un8zPtYLfkv7k38f9w?usp=sharing).  
- Make sure to install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running the app.  
- The app runs locally; no internet connection is required for generating posts once the model is downloaded.
